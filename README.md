Are you tired of dealing with writing validation and parsing middleware over and over again? Look no further!
Valideer `válədɪ́ː` is a wrapper for [class-transformer-validator](https://github.com/MichalLytek/class-transformer-validator) providing validation and parsing middleware and helper types for [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) and [Koa](https://github.com/koajs/koa).

Please be advised that Valideer is currently in the developmental stage and does not have a stable release yet
